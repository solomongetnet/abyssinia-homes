Subcities

To create a Mongoose schema for collecting location data in Node.js, you can define a schema with fields for the subcity, neighborhood, and any other relevant information. Here’s an example schema that includes fields for subcity, neighborhood, and some additional details:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// Define the Location schema
const LocationSchema = new Schema({
subcity: {
type: String,
required: true,
enum: [
'Arada',
'Addis Ketema',
'Akaky Kaliti',
'Bole',
'Gullele',
'Kirkos',
'Kolfe Keranio',
'Lideta',
'Nifas Silk-Lafto',
'Yeka',
'Bole Bulbula'
]
},
neighborhood: {
type: String,
required: true
},
description: {
type: String
},
latitude: {
type: Number
},
longitude: {
type: Number
}
});

// Create the Location model
const Location = mongoose.model('Location', LocationSchema);

module.exports = Location;
This schema defines a Location with fields for the subcity, neighborhood, description, latitude, and longitude. The subcity field is restricted to the 11 official subcities in Addis Ababa, and the neighborhood field can be any string representing the neighborhood (such as Piassa, 4 Kilo, 6 Kilo, etc.).

To use this schema in your Node.js application, you can perform operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting location documents using Mongoose. Here is an example of how you might create a new location document:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Location = require('./models/Location'); // Adjust the path as necessary

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
.then(() => {
console.log('MongoDB connected');

    // Create a new location
    const newLocation = new Location({
      subcity: 'Arada',
      neighborhood: 'Piassa',
      description: 'A historical neighborhood in Addis Ababa',
      latitude: 9.0368,
      longitude: 38.7487
    });

    // Save the location
    return newLocation.save();

})
.then(location => {
console.log('Location saved:', location);
mongoose.connection.close();
})
.catch(err => {
console.error('Error:', err);
});
This example demonstrates connecting to a MongoDB database, creating a new location document, and saving it to the database. Adjust the MongoDB connection string and file paths as necessary for your application.
